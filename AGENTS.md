## Context
- This sandbox repo, I take deep dives on various PL concepts and write toy examples and unit tests
  to solidify my understanding of things

## Git usage
- Use `git mv` if renaming files. But do not `git add` not `git commit` I want to keep control of
  that

## Collaboration
- Given the structure of the repo it's unlikely that you have to go very wide for the context.
  Usually the current working directory is enough.
- Always come up with a plan before proceeding
